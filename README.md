This is my hub for examples of my work related to Python, SQL, Machine Learning, and whatever else interests me.

#### Notebooks
This folder contains jupyter notebooks that go over the basics of data loading, cleaning, and creating models using standard python libraries.

#### Price is Right
This folder contains an example of web scraping.  It scrapes The Price is Right Episode Guide pages found here: https://tpirepguide.com/ and specifically looks only for the Showcase Showdown sections.  For information on the portion of this show see: https://priceisright.fandom.com/wiki/Showcase_Showdown
